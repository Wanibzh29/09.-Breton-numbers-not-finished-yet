## II. Description
- The project contains variant form to count in Breton, from the traditionnal form and most used, to the unusual one,
  to the newest form as thought to be more easy to learn in schools for "francophone people" but they are not recommanded to use because they are considered as difficult to understood for most of the bretons speakers.
  
## III. How the project is organized?
- The project is organized like this:
    - Each title of each file have in it letters as "A. 01. .., A. 02. ...".
    - If the filename contains "A." in it, it means that the forms contained in it are "classical ones to count in breton" so they will be most used.
    - If the filename contains "B." in it, it means that it is rare forms.
    - If the filename contains "C'h" in it, it means that they are for particular case.
    - And if filename contains "Ch." in it, it means that it is the neologism forms to count into breton.
    - In the future some (standardized) dialectical forms will be added and will have as letter to distinguish them "D." (for Dialect) in their filenames.
    - In the future all the files contening "E." will be files contening others stuff linked with Breton and Mathematics and counting that could not be contained in the categories above.
    
- When the filename contains "incorr." the correction work isn't done.

## VI. The "Bretons numbers Project" is reused by

- The Open Celtic Dictionary project:
    - Description: (from their description) The goal of the project is to be able to provide speakers of Celtic languages a dictionary API with all words, conjugations, some mutations, translations, and other useful information.
    - Link: https://gitlab.com/prvInSpace/open-celtic-dictionary

- The Discord's bot of the Open Celtic Dictionnary project:

## VI. Some idea to reuse this project

- Here you will find a data-base for a Breton numbers macro, as these one: https://extensions.openoffice.org/fr/project/chiffres-en-lettres?SetFreedomCookie

- Could be very interesant to have a website which propose this kind of stuff in breton: https://leconjugueur.lefigaro.fr/frnombre.php

- The website: https://geriafurch.bzh/fr/nb propose this kind of stuff already. Once this project will be corrected and completed the website "Geriafurch" will normally use it for better proposal.
